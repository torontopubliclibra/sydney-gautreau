        <h5>My childhood nickname was Hector Corrector.</h5>
        <hr />
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the journey of my life has been learning how to channel my insufferable know-it-all energy into editorial expertise. Once I learned to harness and plumb the depths of my seemingly endless curiosity, I found that I had a singular knack for helping writers deepen their thinking and elevate the quality and coherence of their work.</p>
        <p>For many authors, working with an editor is an exercise in vulnerability: allowing someone else into the worlds and ideas and arguments that you've spent days—in some cases, even years—carefully cultivating. I do not take this level of trust lightly; being a permitted guest into authors' writing processes is my greatest source of professional joy.</p>

          <h4>Some particulars about me:</h4>
          <p>I started editing informally in high school, formally in university, and professionally since graduating.</p>
          <p>I completed my Honours Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, where I graduated with High Distinction (Summa Cum Laude for the Americans) in History and English Literature. During my time there, I was published in multiple University journals and awarded the Canadian Labour Congress Book Prize.</p>
