                <blockquote>“Sydney is a driven and insightful editor. She has a keen eye for detail and an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the CMS format. I would not have been able to complete my PhD thesis without her tireless support. Very efficient service in proofing a 400 page thesis manuscript across many months. She came highly recommended from a good friend, and I was extremely impressed by the quality of work. I would not have trusted almost a decade's worth of work to just anyone. I interviewed four editors and she was by far the most experienced and thoughtful.”</blockquote>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“Working with Sydney was a great experience. She is unerringly professional, superbly organized, and extremely easy to
                communicate with. She asked insightful questions that had me see my skills and experiences in a completely new light.
                She helped me create the best artist grant application of my career. The whole process was an enlightening and fun experience. I can't recommend Sydney enough.”</blockquote>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“At first I was on the fence about getting a professional editor for my doctoral thesis, as it seemed a bit of an
                extravagance. However, after having worked with Sydney for almost four months, I can safely say that her services were a
                sound investment. Sydney is a professional and highly competent editor who came to be both my lifeline in the dark final
                months before submission, and also a friend—who cared more about me and my submission than simply doing her job and
                getting paid. I had special requirements (being based at a UK university), which she adapted to quickly and effectively.
                Suffice to say, I cannot recommend Sydney highly enough; she has earned a client for life!”</blockquote>

                <blockquote>“Sydney's fine-tuned editorial skills provided the necessary support and expertise to constructively refine my writing
                through precise and constructive suggestions. Her decisive and clinical insights still allowed me to feel positive and encouraged throughout the editing process.”</blockquote>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“Despite being a published author and copy editor, I struggled mightily with conceptualizing, structuring, and writing
                my grant application. Sydney's breadth of knowledge, as well as her thoughtful and thought-provoking prompts, helped me
                realize what my proposal was actually about. Her keen copy-editing eye gave my writing more clarity and lucidity, and her ability to quickly parse and edit copy gave me enough time to reformulate and rethink my practice. Above and beyond her skillset, her non-judgemental and supportive attitude gave me the confidence to believe I could succeed at a task I had considered hopeless. I cannot recommend her services highly enough.”</blockquote>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“I have only worked with Sydney for a short time, but I knew immediately that her talents for editing and writing are
                one of a kind. After our first conversation I felt inspired to write—which for me is a rare feeling! I initially hired
                Sydney to edit my academic article. She helped me tremendously in producing a clear, quality academic paper in an
                adequate timeframe. She is thorough with her comments and guidance in the editing process. Based on the quality of her
                work and her ability to to capture my thinking, I began writing coaching sessions with Sydney. During these sessions,
                Sydney helped me connect my ideas and frame my thinking. I felt a huge relief as my cloudy thinking cleared after
                talking with her and it gave me the 'nudge' I needed to move forward with a better direction in my writing. I highly recommend Sydney to any academic who is looking to improve their writing and to become inspired to write more.”</blockquote>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“Sydney is my go-to resource for everything related to copy-editing. I have worked with Sydney for over one year on a
                variety of different projects, including developing technical reports, book chapters, and peer-reviewed journal
                articles. She is attentive, flexible, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that projects are completed on
                time and on budget. For example, I remember one time where Sydney worked through the weekend to guarantee that my team
                met the deadline for a grant proposal. Sydney is a delight to work with and her skills have help me elevate my work to
                the next level. Her deft knowledge of the APA citation and referencing requirements has also been invaluable throughout
                the writing process. I happily and whole-heartedly recommend Sydney for any copy-editing project, especially academic
                work involving tight timelines.”</blockquote>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“It can be so difficult to craft words for a project that is close to your heart. Sydney was not only able to help with
                the words I put to my thoughts, but was able to help me distill those thoughts to their most basic essentials. It was a
                very satisfying and smooth process that helped me say what I needed to say in the best way possible.”</blockquote>

            <hr />
            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“Sydney's passion for editing is so organic; she inspires what I've typically found to be a tedious process into the
                most compelling and important aspect of writing. She reminds you of the weight and importance of what you're doing, and
                pushes you out of your comfort zone into a much deeper and stronger place with grace and humour.”</blockquote>

            <hr />
            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“Sydney brings strong technical writing skills to her editing/review process, ensuring that ideas are clearly and
                coherently conveyed to all potential readers: academic, policy, and otherwise. Her turnaround time for review is
                excellent, and prices reasonable. I fully recommend her services.”</blockquote>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <blockquote>“There are not enough words to describe how wonderful Sydney Gautreau is to work with. I have recommended her to many
                people. Aside from the fact that she is smart, passionate, and fun to work with, she's also very supportive and makes a
                fantastic sounding board. She will be my first call the next time I write a novel.”</blockquote>
